# Neighborhood-drawing-tool

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.
A short introduction of this app could easily go here.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)
* [Bower](http://bower.io/)
* [Ember CLI](http://www.ember-cli.com/)
* [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)

If you have a Mac, you should install watchman, probably using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh).

```
brew install watchman
# OR, for the latest version
brew install --HEAD watchman
```

If you get errors that it still can't find watchman or there's something going on with your file system events `FScomputernonsense`, try simply restarting your computer instead of banging your head for an hour. For some reason, [restarting seems to work](http://discuss.emberjs.com/t/watchman-installed-but-ember-cli-cant-find-it/7287/5).
